<p>In this exercise, you will combine string indexing, slicing, and concatenation to manipulate a string in multiple ways.</p>

<ol>
<li>In the code cell below, define a string with at least 10 characters (e.g., "python is so fun") and assign it to a variable</li>
<li>Extract and print the first character</li>
<li>Extract and print the first three characters</li>
<li>Extract and print the last three characters</li>
<li>Concatenate the first three and last three characters to form a new string, and print it</li>
<li>Create a string containing every other character starting with the second character, and print it</li>
<li>Verify what is printed to make sure you get the expected output.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Hints</h2>

<ul>
<li>How do you get the last three characters without knowing the string length?</li>
<li>What does "every other character starting with the second" mean in slice notation?</li>
</ul>
